    <title>About fly air</title>
    <text color="red">
      With more than 21,000 private jets available around the world and an additional 7,000 more expected to come online by 2026, more people are flying privately than ever. In the U. S. alone there was a 5.5% increase in the number of flights between 2019 and 2020 despite the pandemic and there is every reason to believe the trend will continue upward. The primary challenge that comes with a private jet is the large investment of time and money for operations and maintenance. Charter flight services eliminate the bulk of these concerns and make a private flight available to a wider demographic. It’s a dramatic improvement, yet many legacy air charters are lagging behind the times with limited choices of aircraft leading to poor options in flight ability to interested travelers. Even when they do respond it is often slow. Further, it is often difficult or impossible to split or share flights with friends and colleagues.
